# Online-Store
My Capstone project for the full stack web developer bootcamp at HyperionDev.

# Project name
Served Safely

# Description 
A food delivery service that specializes in sanitization. Since the start of covid sanitization has been a large buisiness factor.
This website aims to solve that problem.
It has a menu and a shopping cart for easy ordering and checkout.

# Installation
This project does not need to be installed. Simply open the index.html file found in the online_store folder.

# Usage

## Home Page
On the home page you can choose to view the menu, login or view the delivery policy.
On the top we have the navigation bar which will be present on every page.

## Menu Page
On the menu page you can see all of the items at once. Each item has an add to cart button so entire order can be placed from the menu page.
Each item image is clickable which opens the page for that item.
